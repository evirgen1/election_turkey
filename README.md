# Election Data Repository

Hello everyone; I am delighted to share this election data repository with you. This initiative began out of the necessity to offer easily accessible and efficient Turkey's election results data to the public.

## Motivation

You know the struggle if you've ever tried to get election data from the YSK (Supreme Election Council). The data sets provided by YSK's official website are often hard to use due to their complex structure and lack of comprehensive documentation. Thus, the mission of this repository is to bridge that gap.

## What's in the Repository?

This repository contains structured and clean election results data sets. I started by uploading the local elections data from 2014 and 2019 (You can find them in the Local Elections folder as local_2014.csv and local_2019.csv). However, my goal is to include all election results in a short amount of time. 

## Contribution and Feedback

Your feedback is vital to the accuracy and reliability of these data sets. Feel free to inform me if you need any corrections or issues. You can contact me at [yevirge1@binghamton.edu](mailto:yevirge1@binghamton.edu). 

I wholeheartedly appreciate your support in making these data sets more accurate and useful. Let's democratize access to election data!

Stay tuned for more updates.
